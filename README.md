# FunWithP5
Some math and fun stuff with P5

## How to have fun
Modify the draw function to enable one function at a time. Each function contains a different visualization. The Slider functionality only works for recurrsion tree. Have Fun! and don't mind the code quality cause I'm lazy. _/\_
```function draw () {
    // drawClock();
    // fiboExperiment();
    // tenPrint();
    // pattern2();
   	drawRecursionTree(200);
}```
